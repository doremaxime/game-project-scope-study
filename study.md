## Deliverables

After reading the `game-project` prompt and the `game-project-api` documentation
please do the following and be prepared to share and discuss during our next
class.

Submit detailed answers to the following in this file via a pull request:

-   A wireframe of what your game project will look like.
  - I have added an image to the pull.
-   The data structure you plan to use.
  - html will create the content
  - css will create the visual
  - ajax will communicate with the server
  - js will create the game engine.

-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS
  - What is the markup? do you mean how I will create the game function? If so by breaking it down to everything that needs to be done in comments/english. Then I will translate it into code and test it out.

-   How you plan to approach this project.
  - By oulining everything that needs to be done before doing it. This will allow me to know what my time schedule will look   like (how much time to spend doing what). I believe I will make the html and css first (nothing fancy). Then the game function. Then the curl & ajax. Once these have been done and it all works and I still have time, I will improve the aethetics of the site.

-   4-8 user stories for your game project.
  - I will write 1-2 user stories per day.

-   How you plan to keep your code modular.
  - I'll keep code in different files. I will have a test folder and a official folder. Once files are ready and tested I will add them to the official folder. I will also commit often so as to keep track of everything.

-   What creative spin will you add to your project?
  - I am currently not planning on putting a spin to this game. Only if I finish before Monday will I do somethinga bit more original.

-   How will you use version control to backup / track your project?
-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses?
  - I am currently not planning on attempting any bonuses. Only if I finish before Monday will I attempt one or more.

You may want to submit pictures for your wireframes and/or user stories.
